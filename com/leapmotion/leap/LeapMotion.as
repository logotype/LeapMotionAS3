    /**
	 * The LeapMotion class is your main interface to the Leap device.
	 *
	 * Create an instance of this LeapMotion class to access frames of tracking
	 * data and configuration information. Frame data can be polled at any time
	 * using the LeapMotion.frame() function. Call frame() or frame(0) to get
	 * the most recent frame. Set the history parameter to a positive integer
	 * to access previous frames. A controller stores up to 60 frames in its
	 * frame history.
	 *
	 * Polling is an appropriate strategy for applications which already have
	 * an intrinsic update loop, such as a game. You can also add an event
	 * listener to LeapMotion.controller to handle events as
	 * they occur. The Leap dispatches events to the listener upon initialization
	 * and exiting, on connection changes, and when a new frame of tracking data
	 * is available.
	 *
	 * The LEAPMOTION_INIT event is dispatched when the Leap is ready for use.
	 * When a connection is established between the controller and the Leap,
	 * the controller dispatches the LEAPMOTION_CONNECTED event. At this point,
	 * your application will start receiving frames of data. The controller
	 * dispatches the LEAPMOTION_FRAME event each time a new frame is available.
	 * If the controller loses its connection with the Leap software or device
	 * for any reason, it dispatches the LEAPMOTION_DISCONNECTED event.
	 * If the listener is removed from the controller or the controller is
	 * destroyed, it dispatches the LEAPMOTION_EXIT event. At that point,
	 * unless the listener is added to another controller again, it will no
	 * longer receive frames of tracking data.
	 *
	 * The LeapMotion object is multithreaded and calls the Listener
	 * functions on its own thread, not on an application thread.
	 *
