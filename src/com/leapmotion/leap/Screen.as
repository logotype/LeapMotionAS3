	 * The Screen class represents a computer monitor screen.
	 * 
	 * <p>The Screen class reports characteristics describing the position and
	 * orientation of the monitor screen within the Leap coordinate system.
	 * These characteristics include the bottom-left corner position of the
	 * screen, direction vectors for the horizontal and vertical axes of the
	 * screen, and the screen's normal vector. The screen must be properly
	 * registered with the Screen Locator for the Leap to report these
	 * characteristics accurately. The Screen class also reports the size
	 * of the screen in pixels, using information obtained from the operating
	 * system.</p>
	 * 
	 * <p>(Run the Screen Locator from the Leap Application Settings dialog,
	 * on the Screen page.)</p>
	 * 
	 * <p>You can get the point of intersection between the screen and a ray
	 * projected from a Pointable object using the <code>Screen.intersect()</code> function.
	 * Likewise, you can get the closest point on the screen to a point in
	 * space using the <code>Screen.distanceToPoint()</code> function. Again, the screen
	 * location must be registered with the Screen Locator for these
	 * functions to return accurate values.</p>
	 * 
	 * <p>Note that Screen objects can be invalid, which means that they do not
	 * contain valid screen coordinate data and do not correspond to a
	 * physical entity. Test for validity with the <code>Screen.isValid()</code> function.</p>
