	/**
	 * The Gesture class represents a recognized movement by the user.
	 *
	 * The Leap watches the activity within its field of view for certain movement
	 * patterns typical of a user gesture or command. For example, a movement from
	 * side to side with the hand can indicate a swipe gesture, while a finger poking
	 * forward can indicate a screen tap gesture.
	 *
	 * When the Leap recognizes a gesture, it assigns an ID and adds a Gesture object
	 * to the frame gesture list. For continuous gestures, which occur over many frames,
	 * the Leap updates the gesture by adding a Gesture object having the same ID and
	 * updated properties in each subsequent frame.
	 *
	 * Important: Recognition for each type of gesture must be enabled using the
	 * Controller.enableGesture() function; otherwise no gestures are recognized
	 * or reported.
	 *
	 * Subclasses of Gesture define the properties for the specific movement
	 * patterns recognized by the Leap.
	 *
	 * The Gesture subclasses for include:
	 * CircleGesture – A circular movement by a finger.
	 * SwipeGesture – A straight line movement by the hand with fingers extended.
	 * ScreenTapGesture – A forward tapping movement by a finger.
	 * KeyTapGesture – A downward tapping movement by a finger.
	 *
	 * Circle and swipe gestures are continuous and these objects can have a state
	 * of start, update, and stop.
	 *
	 * The screen tap gesture is a discrete gesture. The Leap only creates a single
	 * ScreenTapGesture object appears for each tap and it always has a stop state.
	 *
	 * Get valid Gesture instances from a Frame object. You can get a list of gestures
	 * with the Frame.gestures() method. You can get a list of gestures since a specified
	 * frame with the Frame.gesturesSince() methods. You can also use the Frame.gesture()
	 * method to find a gesture in the current frame using an ID value obtained
	 * in a previous frame.
	 *
	 * Gesture objects can be invalid. For example, when you get a gesture by ID using
	 * Frame.gesture(), and there is no gesture with that ID in the current frame, then
	 * gesture() returns an Invalid Gesture object (rather than a null value).
	 * Always check object validity in situations where a gesture might be invalid.
