	/**
	 * The Controller class is your main interface to the Leap Motion Controller.
	 *
	 * <p>Create an instance of this Controller class to access frames of tracking
	 * data and configuration information. Frame data can be polled at any time using
	 * the <code>Controller::frame()</code> function. Call <code>frame()</code> or <code>frame(0)</code>
	 * to get the most recent frame. Set the history parameter to a positive integer
	 * to access previous frames. A controller stores up to 60 frames in its frame history.</p>
	 *
	 * <p>Polling is an appropriate strategy for applications which already have an
	 * intrinsic update loop, such as a game. You can also implement the Leap::Listener
	 * interface to handle events as they occur. The Leap Motion dispatches events to the listener
	 * upon initialization and exiting, on connection changes, and when a new frame
	 * of tracking data is available. When these events occur, the controller object
	 * invokes the appropriate callback function defined in the Listener interface.</p>
	 *
	 * <p>To access frames of tracking data as they become available:</p>
	 *
	 * <ul>
	 * <li>Implement the Listener interface and override the <code>Listener::onFrame()</code> function.</li>
	 * <li>In your <code>Listener::onFrame()</code> function, call the <code>Controller::frame()</code> function to access the newest frame of tracking data.</li>
	 * <li>To start receiving frames, create a Controller object and add event listeners to the <code>Controller::addEventListener()</code> function.</li>
	 * </ul>
	 *
	 * <p>When an instance of a Controller object has been initialized,
	 * it calls the <code>Listener::onInit()</code> function when the listener is ready for use.
	 * When a connection is established between the controller and the Leap,
	 * the controller calls the <code>Listener::onConnect()</code> function. At this point,
	 * your application will start receiving frames of data. The controller calls
	 * the <code>Listener::onFrame()</code> function each time a new frame is available.
	 * If the controller loses its connection with the Leap Motion software or
	 * device for any reason, it calls the <code>Listener::onDisconnect()</code> function.
	 * If the listener is removed from the controller or the controller is destroyed,
	 * it calls the <code>Listener::onExit()</code> function. At that point, unless the listener
	 * is added to another controller again, it will no longer receive frames of tracking data.</p>
